=== Description ===
--------------------

Newton is a slightly different approach to the familiar three columned layout we all know so well. Instead of restricting everything in the middle of the screen the sidebars are free to float to the outermost edges. Newton supports several post formats, scales well to all screen sizes and is accessibility-ready.
